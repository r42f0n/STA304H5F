STA304H5F: Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data
Technical   Report   Instructions
The   typical   flow   of a   technical   article   is:   abstract,   introduction,   methodology,   analysis,   discussion/results,   conclusion/limitations,   appendix.   It   does   NOT   need   to   follow   this         exact   format   (some journal   articles   have   slightly   different   formats)   .
Depending   on   how   much you   want   to   elaborate, you   can   split   certain   sections   into   two   parts   (i.e.   Analysis   could   become   Quantitative   Analysis   and   Qualitative   analysis.)   You         have   free   reign   to decide your   outline   insofar   as   it   makes   logical   sense.
Journal   articles   are   often   written   for   an   audience   that   knows   statistics well. That   is,
you   will   not   need   to   elaborate   terms   such   as   p-values,   null      alternative   hypotheses,
etc.   It   will   be   the   responsibility   of the   reader   to   understand   the   statistical   analysis
method.   However,   it   would   be   nice   to   have   some   plain   language   conclusions   at   the   end   for   readability.
We   do   not   expect   students   to   write   or   perform   literature   review,   ethical   statements,
conflicts   of interest,   or   funding.   (However,   it   would   be   nice   to   include   literature   review   if   you   had   the   time.)
We   are   expecting   students   to   use   either   LaTeX,   R-Markdown,   or   Quarto   for   the   report.
WARNING:   DO   NOT   SAY   AFFECT   AND   OTHER   WORDS   THAT   IMPLY   CAUSALITY.
(SUCH   AS:   Influence,   impact,   contribute…)
This   is   not   a   controlled   randomized   trial!   You   should   look   for   words   such   as   association,   relationship,   connection.
1.   Abstract
In   prior   versions   of this   course,   we   did   not   request   for   an   abstract.   However,   abstracts   are   necessary   for   any   academic   article.   Your   abstract   should   be   a   quick   summary   of
your   paper   and   is   shown   before   the   introduction. They   are   used   for   other   researchers   to   tell   whether   the   paper   is   worth   reading.   It   should   address   the   following:
•               A   brief introduction   to   the   topic.
•               Aim   of the   paper.
•          A   brief statement   regarding   the   data   collection   methodology.
•               A   summary   of key   findings.
•          A   brief overview   of implications   of results,   or   what   needs   to   be   improved.


Here’s   an   example   of an   abstract   (colour   coded   to   match   the   above   description):
In a statistics program, most courses emphasize statistical theory over practical applications, often resulting in a focus on examinations rather than assignments. However, many statistics programs include a course on survey and sampling design, where students can be assessed through projects. Designing these projects requires more resources than tests, including increased grading workload and time spent resolving group conflicts. This study examines whether students prefer projects over traditional examinations and identifies the benefits they perceive from project-based learning. In a third-year statistics survey  sampling course, we asked students their perceptions of project based learning through Google Forms after completion of the final project. The results show that 81% of students prefer projects and found them useful for developing skill sets necessary for the workforce. The main reasons for disliking projects were group conflicts and unclear instructions. In response, we plan to provide more resources to support student success and to find ways to mitigate potential group disputes in the future.
2.   Introduction
Within   the   introduction,   the   following   questions   should   be   answered:
•          What   is   your   study   about   and   why   should   we   care?
•          What   background   information   is   necessary   to   let   the   reader   understand?
•               What   are your   research   questions?
•               What   are your   hypotheses?
•          What   is   the   brief outline   of the   rest   of   your   paper?
Below,   a   student   wrote   two   different   drafts   of an   introduction   regarding   a   study   including   cannabis   usage:
Draft      1:
Those   opposed   to   the   decriminalization   of cannabis   will   often   cite   that   it   is   destroying the youth   and   their   cognitive   ability   to   function   in   society.   Cannabis   is   a   popular   drug   that   people   occasionally   will   smoke   for   leisure   activity. There   are   studies   done   that show   that   prolonged   cannabis   consumption   is   not   good   for   brain   development,   and perhaps   this   could   influence   students   to   care   less   about   school.   We   aim   to   analyze   the   following   research   question:
•          (RQ1)   What   are   the   impacts   of cannabis   usage   on   lecture   attendance?
o      Null   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   has   no   association   on   lecture   attendance.
o      Alternative   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   is   correlated   with   a   lower   attendance   rate.
•          (RQ2)   What   are   the   impacts   of cannabis   usage   on   students’   grades?
o      Null   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   has   no   association   on   students’   grades.
o      Alternative   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   is   correlated   with   lower   grades.
•          (RQ3)   Do   students   perceive   cannabis   to   be   a   positive   asset   in   their   life?
o      Null   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   is   not   associated with   being   an   advantage   to   one’s   life.
o      Alternative   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   is   linked   to   improving   one’s   lifestyle.
There   are   some   issues   with   this   introduction:
1.       Fairly   bland,   boring,   and   sometimes   awkward.
2.         It   doesn’t   transition   well,   i.e.,   the   introduction   of research   questions   were   quite   abrupt.
3.         What   is   their   exact   population?   Where   could   they   be   gathering   this   information?
4.         What   is   the   outline   for   the   rest   of the   paper?
Draft   2:
This   study   examines   the   impact   of cannabis   consumption   on   university   students' lecture   attendance.   Cannabis,   a   psychoactive   substance   frequently used   by young   adults   for   recreational   purposes,   has   garnered   increasing   attention   due   to   its   potential   implications   for   cognitive   and   behavioral   outcomes,   particularly   among   students.
Extensive   research   has   suggested   that   prolonged   and   frequent   cannabis   consumption      may   have   adverse   effects   on   brain   development   and   cognitive   function   (Iversen,   2003)   .
In   light   of this,   we   formulate   the   hypothesis   that   individuals   who   engage   in   regular, weekly   cannabis   use   are   more   prone   to   reduced   lecture   attendance. This   research   endeavors   to   investigate   the   relationship   between   cannabis   consumption   patterns   and   student   engagement   with   academic   activities,   shedding   light   on   an   area   of   growing concern   in   contemporary   education.
The   structure   of the   paper   is   as   follows:   Section   2   outlines   our   data   collection methods.   Section   3   presents   our   quantitative   analysis.   In   Section   4,   we   explore feedback   from   students   and   the   common   themes   that   arise.   Section   5   discusses   the qualitative   results   and   addresses   our   research   question.   Section   6   covers   the   limitations   of our   study,   and   Section   7   concludes   our   analysis.
Again,   there   are   some   issues with   this   introduction:
1.         This   is   not   concise   (mostly   the   second   paragraph),   and   honestly   boring   to   read.   It   sounds   like   there   is   an   abundance   of “fluff” to   over-compensate   for   lack   of substance.   (What   is   contemporary   education?)
2.         The   research   questions   and   hypotheses   are   not   clear.   (They   also   don’t   mention   enough.)
3.         Again,   we   are   unsure   of the   exact   population   and   where   they   could   possibly   be   gathering   this   information.
We   can   combine   drafts      1   and   2,   and   integrate   the   missing   pieces,   to   create   a   superior   introduction   (note:   longer   doesn’t   always   mean   better,   it’s just   that   the   previous   two drafts   had   missing   information)   .
Final   Draft:
Cannabis   faces   significant   stigma   from   older   generations   due   to   its   illegalization   and negative   stereotypes,   such   as   the   belief   that   it   increases   laziness.   Moreover,   extensive   research   suggests   that   prolonged   and   frequent   cannabis   consumption   may   have adverse   effects   on   brain   development   and   cognitive   function   (Iversen,   2003)   .   While   some   individuals   may   use   cannabis   for   recreational   purposes,   it   can   also   provide   relief   from   medical   conditions   that   induce   high   levels   of pain.
In   this   study,   we   analyze   whether   the   stigma   against   cannabis   is   well-deserved.
Specifically,   we   examine   the   impact   of cannabis   consumption   on   university   students'   lecture   attendance   and   grades   at   a   North   American   intensive   university.   In   October 2024,   we   deployed   a   survey   via   email   to   collect   data   on   students’   cannabis   usage, academic   performance,   demographic   factors,   and   attitudes   towards   cannabis. The   survey   included   both   users   and   non-users   of cannabis   for   comparisons.   Additionally,   we   carefully   differentiated   between   prescribed   and   recreational   cannabis   use.   We   aim   to   study   the   following   research   questions:
•          (RQ1)   What   are   the   impacts   of cannabis   usage   on   lecture   attendance?
o      Null   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   has   no   association   on   lecture   attendance.
o      Alternative   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   is   correlated   with   a   lower   attendance   rate.
•          (RQ2)   What   are   the   impacts   of cannabis   usage   on   students’   grades?
o      Null   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   has   no   association   on   students’   grades.
o      Alternative   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   is   correlated   with   lower   grades.
•          (RQ3)   Do   students   perceive   cannabis   to   be   a   positive   asset   in   their   life?
o      Null   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   is   not   associated with   being   an   advantage   to   one’s   life.
o      Alternative   hypothesis:   cannabis   usage   is   linked   to   improving   one’s   lifestyle.
The   structure   of the   paper   is   as   follows:   Section   2   outlines   our   data   collection methods.   Section   3   presents   our   quantitative   analysis.   In   Section   4,   we   explore feedback   from   students   and   the   common   themes   that   arise.   Section   5   discusses   the qualitative   results   and   addresses   our   research   question.   Section   6   covers   the   limitations   of our   study,   and   Section   7   concludes   our   analysis.
3.   Methodology
This   is   where you   outline your   data   collection   methodology   in   detail.
●          Where   and   when   was   the   data   collected?   (Piazza,   lectures,   tutorials,   online   databases…)
●          What   sampling   method   did you   use?   (SRS,   stratified,   etc.…)
○          How   did you   ensure   randomness?    (randomly   sampling   from   an   R
program,   systematically   de代 写STA304H5F: Surveys, Sampling and Observational DataPython

●          What   were   your   strata,   if any?
●          What   was   your   sample   size?
●          What   is   a   general   summary   of the   questions you   asked?    (What   are your   variables?)
Below   we   present   an   example.
Between   May   2023   to   August   2023,   a   survey   meant   to   understand   students’   academic   performance   and   recreational   drug   usage   was   deployed   within   an   introductory   statistics   course   at   a   research-intensive   North   American   university.   We   utilized   simple   random   sampling   by   using   a   Python   random   generator   to   randomly   sample   50   students   from   an   email   list   of all   students   taking   the   introductory   statistics   course   (N   =   242)   .   Out   of   50   students,    19   did   not   respond,   thus   we   were   left   with   only   (n   =   31)   responses. The   survey   consisted   of   10   short   answer   questions,   asking   for   their   average   cannabis   usage   per   week,   lecture   attendance,   and   miscellaneous   demographic   factors         (gender,   program   of study,   age.)
4.   Analysis
WARNING:   In   a journal   article,   codes   are   not   provided   unless   in   an   appendix.   Do   not   put   R-code   here.
Things   that   are   included   in   this   section:
●            Show   relevant   graphs      tables.
●          Show   computations   for   your   sample   size.
●          Necessary   assumptions   for   tests   are   shown   before   utilizing   them.   (If   assumptions   are   not   satisfied, you   should   not   be   using   that   test!)
○          For   example,   the   assumptions   for   the   two-sample   test   for   mean   are   the   following:
■          The   samples   are   independent   from   each   other      are   obtained   randomly.
■          The   samples   are   normally   distributed.
■          The   variances   for   the   two   independent   groups   are   equal.
●          Show   the   outputs   of the   computations   and   statistical   tests,   i.e.,   p-values,   test-   statistics   are   provided   here.
○          Remark:   the   tests   for   significance   should   be   done   at   the   0.05   level.
●          Some   statistical   information   that   may   be   useful   to   reference    (depending   on   the   context):   standard   deviation,   confidence   interval,   median,   IQR.
If you   have   used   a   questionnaire,   use   N   =   200   for   computing   the   sample   size.   n,   unfortunately,   is   already   known.   So,   you   will   be   reverse   calculating   as   if you   wanted   a   certain   bound   to   fit   your   sample   size.
You   do   NOT   need   to   show   EVERYTHING you   computed.   Only   the   computations   that you   will   DISCUSS   in   the   report.   Normally,   a   lot   of side-things you   compute   at   first   will   have   no   statistically   significant   results.   (I.e.,   gender   may   have   no   connection   with   the         amount   of cannabis   a   person   will   smoke.)
Part   of this   project   is   having   the   ability   to   decipher   what   is   important   to   report.   This   is   a   snippet   of what   to   include   in   the   analysis   section:
For   our   study,   our   population   size   is   N   =   300   and   we   plan   to   collect   data   using   simple   random   sampling. To   determine   a   sample   size   to   collect,   we’ll   go   with   the   calculation focusing   on   the   mean   population   parameter.   It   is   assumed   that   there   is   an   equal proportion   amongst   those   who   enjoy   projects   in   courses   versus   those   who   enjoy   examinations.   Hence,   given   a   bound   of error   of 0.13,   the   sample   size   calculation   ends   up   being   like:
   
Hence,   we   sampled   50   students   for   our   analysis.
We   found   that   40%   of our   participants   identified   as   male   (n   =   20),   and   the   rest   were   female   (n   =   30)   .   We   also   had   64%   domestic   students   (n   =   32)   and   36%   international   students   (n   =    18)   .   Surprisingly,   only   40%   said   they   preferred   projects   over   examinations   (n   =   20)   .
To   answer   RQ1,   we   need   to   calculate   the   one-sample   proportion   test.   All   of our assumptions   are   satisfied,   as   we   have   a   random   sample,   a   binomial   distribution   (two   binary   outcomes/choices)   and   we   have   at   least   5   from   each   outcome   (np   =   20,   n(1-p)   =   30)   .   We   obtain   a   Chi-square   test   statistic   of   2,   df   =    1,   and   p   =   0.1573.
RQ2   tries   to   determine   if certain   demographic   factors   contribute   to   whether   someone   prefers   assignments.   Again,   we   need   to   check   if the   assumptions   for   the   two-sample   proportion   test   are   satisfied.   We   have   the   same   binomial   distribution,   and   the   samples   are   still   independent   from   each   other.
Below   is   a   table   that   summarizes   the   last   assumptions.   All   assumptions were   satisfied,   so   we   included   a   brief result   of the   statistical   test.
We   also   analyzed   the   Likert   scale   data,   which   had   options   which   ranged   from:
“strongly   disagree”,   “disagree”,   “slightly   disagree”,   “neutral”,   “slightly   agree”,   “agree”,   and   “strongly   agree”   .   We   denoted   “strongly   disagree”   as    1,   “strongly   agree”   as   7.
To   see   whether   students   perceived   their   skills   to   be   enhanced   through   project   courses   in   general,   we   conducted   the   one-sample   t-test   for   the   mean,   where   option   4   (neutral)      denotes   no   change. The   assumptions   for   the   one-sample   test   involves   the   data   being   randomly   selected,   independent   from   each   other,   and   the   normal   appears   normally   distributed. The   first   two   conditions   have   been   addressed,   and   the   last   condition   can   be   satisfied   by   the   central   limit   theorem   due   to   having   50   samples   which   is   greater   than   30.
Below   is   a   summary   of the   Likert   scale   questions,   as   well   as   the   one-sample   test   for   the   mean:
Remark      1:   some   interesting   data   points   to   include   would   be   the   confidence   interval,   which   I   omitted   due   to   laziness.   I   also   did   not   include   “advanced   tests”   .
Remark   2:   it was   unrelated   to   any   of the   research   questions,   but   if   you   peek   at   the attached   code   file   I   tested   to   see   if there   were   any   differences   amongst   the   perceptions   of Likert   scale   answers   between   male      female,   and   international      domestic. There   were   no   differences,   so   I   did   not   include   them.   If you   have   time   for   more   results,   and   they   do   end   up   being   significant,   it   would   be   interesting   to   include   them.
5.   Discussion/Results
In   this   section you   should write   the   interpretation   of   your   results   ,   and   hopefully   in   plain   language   conclusions.
You   may   also   use   this   section   to   elaborate   facts   regarding   a   table   or   a   graph   in   detail,   such   as   pointing   out   abnormalities   or   highlighting   the   stark   differences   between   two            groups   in your   data.
A   discussion   section   is   typically   longer   the   more   interesting   the   results,   but   it   can   be   made   relatively   short   if no   results   were   found.
6.   Limitations
Briefly   mention   limitations   and   what   should   be   done   in   the   future.   Consider   what you   would’ve   changed   in your   survey   if   you   went   back   in   time   to   redo   the   study.   A   common   limitation   in   studies   involve   an   inadequate   sample   size,   failing   to   reject   the   null   hypothesis,   missing   confounding   variables,   biased   sample   size   and/or   survey,            poor   survey   questions.
A   common   issue   in   prior years   is   that   students   mentioned   limitations   that   were   more   of a   critique   of the   method   as   opposed   to   their   own   study. They   probably   stole   these   ideas   from   ChatGPT.   As   a   warning,   the   following   are   not   sufficient   limitations   (and   I   will   address   why):
•             Lack   of causal   connections.   STA304’s   official   name   is   “Survey,   Sampling,   
Observational   Data”   .   Observational   data,   in   nature,   will   never   lead   to   causal         results.   If   you want   to   make   a   causal   connection, you’re   in   the   wrong   course.
•             Self-reported   data.   You   want   to   stalk   and   hack   into   a   database   that   reveals      information   about your   fellow   classmates just   for your   project!?   The   course      name   also   includes   “surveys”!   Surveys   will   always   be   tied   with   self-reported   data.
•          Temporal   factors.   Maybe   this   would   cause   an   effect   …   But   realistically,   are you   going   to   spend   a year   collecting   survey   data?   I   doubt   most   people’s   opinions don’t   drastically   change   unless your   project   is   entirely   season   dependent   …
There   are   more   nonsensical   answers   that   generative   AI   tools   will   spout   out.   I   am   begging you   to   take   a   second   to   think   about your   limitations   rather   than   consulting   AI.   (In   fact,   I   may   have   literally   given   the   answers   in   the   first   paragraph   of this section.)
Here’s   an   example   of an   adequate   limitation   section:
In   our   study we   tried   to   see   which   demographic   factors   (gender,   ethnicity,   domestic   or international,   and year   of study)   are   linked with   an   overreliance   of using   AI   tools   using   the   Chi   Square   test   for   independence   or   the   non-parametric   Fisher’s   exact   test   (depending   on   whether   the   assumptions   of the   Chi   square   were   satisfied)   .
Unfortunately,   in   all   cases   we   failed   to   reject   the   null   hypothesis.   Hence,   there   are   no   ties   between   various   demographic   factors   and   whether   students   tend   to   use   AI   tools.      In   fact,   we   found   that   90%   of students   admitted   to   using AI   generative   tools.   As   a
result,   we   are   less   likely   to   see   any   relationships   due   to   a   high   majority   already   using   them.   In   the   future,   we   will   incorporate   open-ended   questions   to   ask   students   to elaborate   on   their   preferences.
7.   Conclusion
In   this   section you   should   have   the   following:
•            Summarize your   findings   and   explicitly   answer your   research   questions.
o   No   new   information   should   be   provided;   everything   mentioned   here   should   have   been   mentioned   in   the   past.
•       Talk   about   more   in   detail   of what   researchers   should   do   in   the   future.
Naturally,   people   may wonder   the   difference   between   an   abstract   and   the   conclusion.
•       The   abstract   is   supposed   to   be   a   concise   summary   of the   entire   paper.   It   goes   through   the   phrases   of an   introduction,   methodology,   analysis,   and   results.
•       The   conclusion   does   summarize   the   paper   but   emphasizes   on   the   latter   half of         the   paper   (results   and   limitations)   .   It   does   not   include   background   information.   It   will   also   re-address   limitations   and   go   into   depth   about   future   directions.
